Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artimis Financial was having some testing and security issues. We ultimitely helped revamp their software security to ensure their clients stay safe. We ran dependency checks and created cipher algorithms.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I think I did well in cyphering and running dependency checks. Coding securely is important because it protects sensitive information from cyber threats and data breaches, ensuring the integrity and reliability of applications. Software security adds value to a company by building trust with customers and ensuring compliance with regulations.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The worst for me was probably in creating the certificates.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
We encrypted code to avoid potential threats. In the future, I would likely use tools such as a vulnerability scanners to identify potential risks. Once vulnerabilities are identified, I would prioritize them based on factors like severity (or vulnerability) giving informed decisions for appropriate mitigation techniques.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To ensure the code and software application were functional and secure, I used automated testing, alongside static analysis tools to identify potential security flaws. After refactoring the code, I conducted regression testing and vulnerability assessments, and used dynamic analysis and code review to check for new vulnerabilities that may have been introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Dependency checks from Maven builds and forming suppressions are things I will likely carry with me to many situations in my time moving forward.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show my dependency checks and suppressions. My refracted codes could've been built better, but I am also proud that I was able to successfully created defined certificates.
